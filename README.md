Video Poker Sim
===============

At the casino the other night I learned my parents-in-law's video poker strategy.

I won't explain the rules of 5 card draw poker here but here's the basis of video poker in a casino setting: Money goes in to earn credits (where a credit is the size of one bet). You get odds, or payouts, for various hands and depending on the size of one credit and on how many credits you're betting on a single hand. For this exercise a player can bet up to five credits on one hand to generate better payouts.

The strategy goes like this:
 * Make sure you have a payout of at least 2 for two pair and 1 (your money back) for jacks or better
 * Play single bet until you get paid (two pair or better)
 * Max bet immediately after getting paid for one hand, then return to single betting

In practice this sort of works, so I wanted to simulate thousands of hands to brute force if it *actually* works and how well.

TODO:

 * Model the draw portion of draw poker
 * Model a bankroll and betting
